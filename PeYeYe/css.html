    <h2>SUBSTANCE ABUSE TOOK AWAY THE YOUTH'S FUTURE</h2>
    <p>It is common for any teenager to experiment during his or hers adolescence, so teens will try alcohol, cigarette and some of them even drugs. But how many of those teenagers can stop? Some of those teenagers will experiment and then they will move on, some will continue to use any of those substances occasionally and unfortunately some of them will move onto harder substance abuse. It is a fact that teenage substance abuse is on the rise; the only way to stop that is by noticing early symptoms.<br>

Most teenagers that use alcohol and drugs have a few things in common, mostly their past and their family situation. Children with harsh family history, where signs of substance abuse can be found, are more likely to follow the same path. Children who are depressed and have low self esteem are also to be looked out for. Passive children that don’t fit into society, the ones that stand out are more likely to try something out of desperation, out of the wish to blend in, than children that seem to function normally and blend in with their friends.<br>

Problem of teen drug abuse is not something that started yesterday. So we already know what to do in similar situation, but in order to intervene we must first know the symptoms. If you monitor your child you will see these symptoms, fatigue, personality change, depression, low self esteem, mood swings, defying authority, starting fights and arguments, negative attitude, low grades and sometimes even new friends and problems with the law<br>

    <h2>Health Problems</h2>
    <p>Health problems</a></li>There is no telling what your child may use; there are just too many substances abused by teenagers today. Most common ones are cigarettes, marihuana, cold medication, inhalants, depressants and other stimulants. There is no telling what children can get their hands on, but most of these things can’t be acquired without an adult. So most likely your child is stealing from your home supplies or he or she is getting it from some other adult. Parents must keep an eye on their children; first thing that should be done is sealing your medications away where children can’t find them. Of course you need to take care of people they socialize with. The biggest problem will be if your child is using heavy illegal drugs like cocaine, heroin, meth or some form of hallucinogens. In that case you need to provide immediate professional help.<br>

    <h2>Effects on the brain</h2>
    <p>ffect</a></li>For the brain, the difference between normal rewards and drug rewards can be described as the difference between someone whispering into your ear and someone shouting into a microphone. Just as we turn down the volume on a radio that is too loud, the brain adjusts to the overwhelming surges in dopamine (and other neurotransmitters) by producing less dopamine or by reducing the number of receptors that can receive signals. As a result, dopamine’s impact on the reward circuit of the brain of someone who abuses drugs can become abnormally low, and that person’s ability to experience any pleasure is reduced.<br>

This is why a person who abuses drugs eventually feels flat, lifeless, and depressed, and is unable to enjoy things that were previously pleasurable. Now, the person needs to keep taking drugs again and again just to try and bring his or her dopamine function back up to normal—which only makes the problem worse, like a vicious cycle. Also, the person will often need to take larger amounts of the drug to produce the familiar dopamine high—an effect known as tolerance.
 <h2> how to prevent yourself</h2>The best way to deal with any possible situation is prevention. But considering the teenagers today you have to be careful, forbidding them to experiment may be contra productive, but you need to take care they keep it at a normal level where they don’t endanger their health. By keeping an eye out for your children you might influence him in a negative manner, so talking to your child is probably the best way, you don’t want him to get the feeling you are spying on him. Teen drug abuse is a serious problem on the rise, and according to the studies, it all starts and stops at home. Parents are responsible most of the times, so it is our duty as parents to stop that before it happens, we need to be aware.LET'S SAY NO TO DRUGS,ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
