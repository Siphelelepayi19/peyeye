          <span class="textbold"></span> -<i><b>INTRODUCTION:Addiction is a form of disease, and it can pose a series of negative consequences on a person’s well-being, physical health and professional life. There are many forms of addiction, and each one poses its own series of risks.
While drug and alcohol use often begin as voluntary behaviors, addiction prompts chemical alterations in the brain that affect memory, behavior and the perception of pleasure and pain. Conscious decisions turn into compulsive actions, and major health, financial and social consequences often follow..<i><b>

         <p>
            <span class="textbold"></span> - Many addictive substances are highly regulated and, in certain situations, even banned by local and federal governments. This is done in an attempt to reduce the damage imposed by chronic substance abuse and to protect the well-being of Americans.

Being caught with a large quantity of drugs could result in a prison sentence as long as 40 years. Civil lawsuits may come with it as well, depending on if the person had been distributing the substance.<br> If found guilty on felonious charges, the individual could lose the ability to vote and later have trouble finding employment, especially after serving a prison sentence.

At the moment, approximately 47 percent of inmates serving federal prison sentences are doing so on drug offenses, although most were involved with trafficking on some level.

     <li><a href="health problems">Health problems</a></li>People who suffer from addiction often have one or more accompanying medical issues, which may include lung or cardiovascular disease, stroke, cancer, and mental disorders. Imaging scans, chest X-rays, and blood tests show the damaging effects of long-term drug abuse throughout the body. For example, research has shown that tobacco smoke causes cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, blood, lungs, stomach, pancreas, kidney, bladder, and cervix.19 In addition, some drugs of abuse, such as inhalants, are toxic to nerve cells and may damage or destroy them either in the brain or the peripheral nervous system.
The Impact of Addiction Can Be Far-Reaching:<br>
    Cardiovascular disease
    Stroke
    Cancer
    HIV/AIDS
    Hepatitis B and C
    Lung disease
    Mental disorders

     <li><a href="effects on the brain">Effects on the brain</a></li>For the brain, the difference between normal rewards and drug rewards can be described as the difference between someone whispering into your ear and someone shouting into a microphone. Just as we turn down the volume on a radio that is too loud, the brain adjusts to the overwhelming surges in dopamine (and other neurotransmitters) by producing less dopamine or by reducing the number of receptors that can receive signals. As a result, dopamine’s impact on the reward circuit of the brain of someone who abuses drugs can become abnormally low, and that person’s ability to experience any pleasure is reduced.<br>
This is why a person who abuses drugs eventually feels flat, lifeless, and depressed, and is unable to enjoy things that were previously pleasurable. Now, the person needs to keep taking drugs again and again just to try and bring his or her dopamine function back up to normal—which only makes the problem worse, like a vicious cycle. Also, the person will often need to take larger amounts of the drug to produce the familiar dopamine high—an effect known as tolerance.
     
     <li><a href="injuries">Injuries</a></li>     After a TBI, teens may feel the effects of alcohol and drugs more quickly than before the injury. Some teens may find just a small amount of alcohol or drugs impairs judgment and balance.
    People with TBI may have difficulty thinking, balancing, remembering, and concentrating. Using marijuana, alcohol, and other drugs can make these problems worse.<br>
    Some teens may need to take prescription medications for their injury. When a person mixes prescription medications with drugs or alcohol, a bad reaction can occur, which sometimes can be deadly.
    People under the influence of drugs or alcohol don't always make good choices, and those choices increase their risk for another injury.<br>

After a TBI, most people can't wait to recover and return to their normal activities. And it’s not unreasonable to be sad when you have to sit on the bench while your brain recovers (because it may likely take longer than your body, which feels ready for the field). But what this study tells us is that, while you are free to wallow and feel crummy about your situation, do so without using alcohol and drugs. Drug or alcohol use not only interferes with the recovery process, it can set you up for drug problems—something no athlete wants.<br>
