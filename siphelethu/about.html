<h1>The Danger Of Substance Abuse</h1>
<p><span class="textbold"></span> - Depending on the drug, it can enter the human body in a number of ways, including injection, inhalation, and ingestion.<br> The method of how it enters the body impacts on how the drug affects the person.<br> For example: injection takes the drug directly into the blood stream, providing more immediate effects; while ingestion requires the drug to pass through the digestive system, delaying the effects.</p>
